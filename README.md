# Team ST - Survey

Team ST - Survey project shows how to build a more complex web application with React and Redux.

See live demo [here](http://st-survey.gq/)

## Recently Update

1. Update deprecated codes in react
2. Update bugs in issue
3. Give an easier way to make the back-end work with front-end


## Features

#### Survey editor

#### Survey collect

#### Data view

#### Report process

## Run

The demo only shows a front end of the application. For a fully functioning application, the back end part is also necessary.

### Installing Front-end

```
npm install
export REACT_APP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

### Installing Back-end

Get the back-end part from [here](https://github.com/4501104220/st-survey-api/). This is a Rails 5 application. You need to install Ruby on your machine.

The fastest way to deploy the back end is to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
